# Yearn Improvement Proposals \(YIPs\)

## What is a YIP? Why do they matter?

* A YIP or Yearn Improvement Proposal is how features are added to the Yearn ecosystem. Users start a proposal on the forum, discuss it and gauge the sentiment of if the proposal will be accepted. If a lot of users agree with it then it can be posted on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/yearn) for everyone to vote on without spending gas.

## How many people need to vote to pass a YIP proposed?

* According to [YIP-55](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-55-formalize-the-yip-process/7959) a proposal should be discussed in the forum for at least three days. If after three days there is a 25% “For” vote in the forum poll it will then move to formal voting via Snapshot.
* As established in [YIP-55](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-55-formalize-the-yip-process/7959) there isn't any quorum requirement for a YIP to be approved, but the votation on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/yearn) must be open for at least five days and have a majority support \(&gt; 50%\) in order to pass.

## How do I make a proposal?

* The default template for proposals can be found on [Github](https://github.com/yearn/YIPS/blob/master/yip-X.md) + on the [forum](https://gov.yearn.finance) if you make a post under proposals or discussion it will auto-fill in the template as well.
* The process is roughly:
  1. forum discussion \(minimum three days\)
  2. promote to YIP \(usually done by mods\), add YIP to github, put on Snapshot \(minimum five days off-chain votation\)
  3. announce

## Who can make a proposal?

* Anyone can post a proposal on the forum for discussion within the community. If it's promoted to off-chain votation \(via [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/#/yearn)\), only someone holding 1 YFI can submit it to Snapshot. In case your proposal made it to off-chain votation and you don't have enough YFI, mods will help you.

### Cover

## Governance

The Yearn ecosystem is controlled by YFI token holders who submit and vote on proposals that govern the ecosystem. Proposals that meet quorum requirements \(&gt;20% of the tokens staked in the governance contract\) and generate a majority support \(&gt;50% of the vote\) are implemented by a 9 member multi-signature wallet. Changes must be signed by 6 out of the 9 wallet signers in order to be implemented. The members of the muliti-signature wallet were voted in by YFI holders and are subject to change from future governance votes. Please refer to our FAQ for [the list of the multisig signers](https://docs.yearn.finance/faq#who-are-the-9-multisig-signers).

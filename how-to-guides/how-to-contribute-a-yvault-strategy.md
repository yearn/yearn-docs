# How to Contribute a yVault Strategy

Yearn is only possible due to community contributions. [yVault](https://docs.yearn.finance/products/yvaults) strategy contributors are rewarded with a share of the fees generated by the vaults.

## Strategy Rewards

Strategy contributors are rewarded with a percentage share of the fees generated by the vaults. Currently, this isgit  _0.5% of additional yield_.

This is a share of the 5% performance fee on additional yield, whereby:

- 10% goes to the Strategy Contributor
- 90% goes to the treasury which is then distributed to Governance

Note that 10% of 5% is effectively 0.5%. The reward is payable in [yUSD](../yusd.md). Learn more on [What are the Fees?](https://docs.yearn.finance/faq#what-are-the-fees)

As an example, in September 2020, community contributor [@orbxball](https://gov.yearn.finance/u/orbxball) developed the strategy for the yWETH vault. As such, the yWETH vault splits the 5% performance fee generated from the pool of assets between governance and strategist \([@orbxball](https://gov.yearn.finance/u/orbxball)\) in a 90/10 split.

## How to Contribute?

For inspiration, you can browse through the strategy proposals on the [Governance Forum](https://gov.yearn.finance/c/proposals/strategies/18). This can serve as examples to inspire your strategy proposals.

When you are ready, you can create a yEarn Improvement Proposal \(YIP\) using the instructions and template provided on [How to Make a YIP](https://docs.yearn.finance/how-to-guides/how-to-make-a-yip). In your proposal, you may want to consider the following:

- Alignment to the vision of yEarn
- Potential risks
- Scalability of the strategy
- Sustainability of the strategy into the future

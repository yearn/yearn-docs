# Writing Style Guide

The Yearn Community Writing Style Guide summarizes the standards and best practices **writers** should follow when contributing to Yearn Documentation resources.

## Writing Intent and Tone

Yearn Community materials should cater to readers who are unfamiliar with the Yearn ecosystem. Writers should also assume that their readers have tight schedules and short attention spans, as after all, farming is honest but hard work.

As such, Writers should focus on communicating concepts as clearly and succinctly as possible.

- Use simple language.
- Use short, concise sentences.
- Avoid unnecessary words.
- Remain open and objective.
- Provide examples when possible.
- Provide examples to help explain concepts, but avoid overcomplicating them.
  - Use math when necessary, but keep it simple and visually easy to understand.
- Link to basic terms if necessary.

## Writer Guidelines

### General Rules

- Run all drafts through [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) regularly, and before final submissions.
  - Grammarly will catch most spelling and grammatical errors.
  - Copy rendered text into Grammarly and address any mistakes it flags.
    - HackMD does not identify spelling and grammatical errors.
    - Grammarly will miss errors if it’s given raw Markdown text.
    - Be careful of copy and pasting code from Grammarly to VScode, Grammarly may mess with formatting.

**Please Note**

- When migrating to a new document (i.e., from Google Docs to HackMD):
  - Leave a note in the old file.
  - Provide a link to the latest version.
- Do not blindly accept Grammarly suggestions.
  - Review edits to make sure they make sense.

**Use:**

- [Oxford commas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma).
- [Pluralized, gender-neutral pronouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they).
  - Use “they/their” instead of “he/she/his/hers.”
  - **Examples:** “When they…” or “If users choose to X, then their…”
- The `%` symbol. Do not spell out "percent."
  - **Correct:** 15%
  - **Incorrect:** 15 percent
- Double quotes `" "` for phrases, quotes, etc.
  - Do not use single `' '` quotes.

**Avoid:**

- [First-person language.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person)
  - **Examples:** I, we, our, etc.
- [Second-person language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person) (unless it is appropriate for a guide or action page).
  - **Examples:** "You then..." or "Now you should..."
- Exclamation points.
- Footnotes.
- References to deprecated names for Yearn Components.
  - **Examples:** yyCRV or yUSD instead of yvCurve-Y (see: [Yearn Naming Conventions](../developers/naming-convention.md)).
- Parentheses for stating additional information.
  - **Incorrect:** Development Grants are larger sized ($5,000 to $50,000) grants aimed at individuals or teams building projects around vaults and the broader Yearn ecosystem.
  - **Correct:** Development Grants are generally larger sized grants, ranging from $5,000 to $50,000, aimed at individuals or teams building projects around vaults and the broader Yearn ecosystem.

### Abbreviations

- Use parentheses to define abbreviated terms the first time they appear in a given document.
  - **Example:** A Yearn Improvement Proposal (YIP) is a proposal framework to support new initiatives and to expand the scope of existing ones.

### Acronyms, Decades and Cases

Do not use apostrophes to pluralize acronyms or indicate decades. Add an "s" at the end.

#### Acronyms

- To make an acronym plural:
  - **Correct:** YIPs
  - **Incorrect:** YIP's

#### Decades

- To indicate a decade:
  - **Correct:** 1990s
  - **Incorrect:** 1990's

#### Capitalize

- Names and proper nouns.
- Cities, countries, nationalities, and languages.
- Terms with definitions provided by Yearn.

#### Title Case

- **The [Title Case Converter](https://titlecaseconverter.com/) will keep titles consistent.**
- Follow the New York Times standard.
- Capitalize the first and last words, all nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives.
- Lowercase all articles, conjunctions, and prepositions.

### Currencies

The examples below use dollars, but the same rules apply to all global currencies.

- Use lowercase except when writing "US Dollar.”
- Use figures and the "\$" sign in all except casual references, or amounts without a figure.
  - **Standard:** "The book costs \$4."
  - **Casual:** "Please give me a dollar."
- For amounts under \$1 million, follow this format:
  - **Correct:** $4, $25, $500, $1,000, \$650,000.
- For amounts over \$1 million, use the word, not numerals.
  - **Correct:** "He is worth \$4 million."
  - **Incorrect:** "He is worth \$4,000,000."

### Naming Conventions

#### Cryptocurrencies

- When directly referring to the creation, destruction, or manipulation of a token (particularly as it relates to tooling) or when referencing the token as a currency, in an instructional or conversational setting, or as a conceptual product of the Foundation or its systems:
  - Use the proper prefix if necessary and capitalized TLA version: `wETH`
  - **Example:** “wETH is a token that represents Ether 1:1 and conforms to the ERC20 token standard.”
- Similarly, when referring to exchange pairs:
  - Use: `wETH/DAI`

#### Yearn Products

Please see [Yearn Naming Conventions](../developers/naming-convention.md).

#### Yearn

- When referring to Yearn as a smart contract system, use "The Yearn Protocol."
  - **Example:** “The Yearn Protocol is a set of contracts for yield optimization."
- When referring to Yearn as a body of YFI voters and the general stakeholder community, use "Yearn Community" or simply "Yearn."
  - **Example:** "Yearn passed a vote to decrease the yCRV vault performance fee."
  - **Example:** "The Yearn Community passed a vote to add an additional vault."
- Use "Yearn" for casual references to Yearn and the Yearn Protocol as a whole.

### Numbers

- Spell out numbers below 10.
  - **Examples:** one, two, three, etc.
- Use numerals for numbers above 10, unless starting a sentence.
- For numbers with million, billion, or trillion, use figures in all except casual cases.
  - **Standard:** "The nation has 1 million citizens."
  - **Casual:** "I'd like to make a billion dollars."

### Lists

When bulleted and numbered lists contain complete sentences, capitalize the first word, and follow each with a period. If list items are phrases, no capitalization or punctuation is required.

- _Don't_ use a list with only 1 item.
- Use [parallel construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelism_%28grammar%29) for each item in a list.
- Start with the same [part of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech) for each item (in this case, a verb).
- Use the same verb [tense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_tense#English) for each item.
- Use the same [voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_%28grammar%29) for each item.
- Use the same sentence type (statement, question, exclamation) for each item.
- List items that include definitions should look like this:
  - **Team:** Yearn Protocol Developers and Contributors
  - **Community**: General participants in Yearn forums and chat
- Use dashes rather than asterisks for unordered lists.
  - **Correct:** `-`
  - **Incorrect:** `*`
- Alphabetize lists of names unless there is a clear priority at work.
- Do not use ordered (numbered) lists unless order matters.
- Ordered list items should use the `1. ` repeated.
  - Markdown will automatically generate numbers.

**Example:**

```markdown
1.  Item 1
1.  Item 2
1.  Item 3
1.  Item 3a
1.  Item 3b
```

### Links

- Use [absolute links](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/contribute/how-to-write-links) and standard web URLs when referencing external resources.
- Create descriptive hyperlinks and avoid generic language.
  - **Correct - Descriptive:** (Learn more at [Yearn Documentation](https://docs.yearn.finance/)
  - **Incorrect - Generic:** Learn more [here](https://docs.yearn.finance/).
- Include a `.`outside the link for sentences that end with a link.
- When creating links for parallel translated documents, make sure to update relative links to reflect the correct heading.

### Tables of Contents

- Include a table of contents for documents that span several pages and multiple sections.
- Use the raw Markdown from the Table of Contents above as a template.
  - Be sure to include the line breaks `---` as well to keep formatting consistent.
- The table of contents should list relevant sections for easy navigation.

## Markdown Guide

Yearn documents posted on GitHub are written in Markdown, a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.

- Include line breaks above and below headings.
- Use top-level headers (`#`) only once per document.
  - Do not make multiple top-level headings.
- Avoid repeat headings.
  - They will break auto-generated navigation.
- Avoid trailing spaces.
- Do not use:
  - Em or en [dashes:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Hyphens_and_dashes) `—`
  - Ampersands `&` in titles and headers.
  - Pipes `|` in titles and headers.
  - Curly quotes. Use the plaintext version.
    - **Correct:** `"`
    - **Incorrect:** `“`
  - Escaping parentheses. Use normal parentheses.
    - **Correct:** `(SOMETHING)`
    - **Incorrect:** `\(SOMETHING\)`
- Ensure there is a single hard return at the end of a .md file.
- Use emojis to call attention to an important point, when necessary.
  - Practice discretion and use them sparingly.
  - This [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908) lists emojis and their Markdown shortcuts.

### File a Bug

If a yearn product isn't working like you think it should please visit the appropriate Github repository listed in the [General Resources](##general-resources) section below or search in the [Yearn Github Repo](https://github.com/iearn-finance/yearn-protocol) if the issue already exists. If it does not exist please create a new issue following the issue template present in the repository(repo). If no issue template is present please include enough information such as your browser version, device, etc for that project so that the developers can replicate it and fix it. If the issue already exists you can signal your support by adding a thumbs up to the already existing issue or add any additional helpful information.

### Leave Feedback

Currently we use [yGov Forums - Feedback](https://gov.yearn.finance/c/feedback/2) to raise general feedback.

### Documentation

The Yearn ecosystem is expanse and the need to document it is ever-growing. The Yearn Documentation can be seen at the official [Yearn Docs](https://docs.yearn.finance/) page and it includes everything from High-Level Documentation regarding Yearn itself to more product specific and technical explanations.

Whether you are interested in writing _How To_ guides on how vaults work for the layperson or creating diagrams on how the entire protocol ties together, there is something for everyone. If languages are your _forté_, then translations might be up your alley as Yearn wishes to reach everyone regardless of their native language.

You can see our ongoing progress on the [Github Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/iearn-finance/projects/2) where you can look through any issue which interests you. In order to begin contributing please see our [How to Use Github](https://hackmd.io/4U35op0ORoGT24lzPhbGNQ) guide and begin contributing by submitting a PR adhering to our [Writing Style Guide](https://hackmd.io/dXQecpkJQX6XRy4y7k7j3g).

We use a combination of HackMD, Gitbook, and Github for our [Documentation](https://docs.yearn.finance/). In order to contribute to our diagrams & schemas we use [DrawIO](https://draw.io) in conjunction with Google Drive for versioning. If you are a grammar stickler you can see our [Reviewer Guide here](https://hackmd.io/juTKNn3xTpKJgFDo2AglLw).

You can also join us over at #documentation channel on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6PNv2nF) and introduce yourself.

If this is a bit too confusing right now don't worry about it, please let us know what we can clear up, and in the meantime, you can begin contributing to those HackMD docs immediately from those Github issues and we'll guide you through the rest.
